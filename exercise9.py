# Exercise 9: Basic Calculator
#
# Create a function named `basicCalculator` that takes three arguments: 
# two numbers and a string representing an operation ('add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide'). 
# Perform the provided operation on the two numbers. In operations where the order of numbers is important, 
# treat the first parameter as the first operand and the second parameter as the second operand.
#
# Examples:
# basicCalculator(10, 5, 'subtract') should return 5.
# basicCalculator(10, 5, 'add') should return 15.
# basicCalculator(10, 5, 'multiply') should return 50.
# basicCalculator(10, 5, 'divide') should return 2.
#
# Define the function and then call it below.
def basicCalculator (numa, numb, operation):
    if operation == 'add':
        sum = numa + numb
    elif operation == 'subtract':
        sum = numa - numb
    elif operation == 'multiply':
        sum = numa * numb
    elif operation == 'divide':
        sum = numa / numb
    return sum



print('Exercise 9 Result:', basicCalculator(10, 5, "subtract"))
